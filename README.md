# Air Core gauges

3D models for coilforms, code and circuit designs for driving them

## spooler

3D parts for building a machine for winding air-core coils

## coilforms

3D printable coilforms, remember to put the rotor inside. (there will be more details to follow)

## driver

Arduino code to generate PWM to drive the aircores, I2C controlled.
